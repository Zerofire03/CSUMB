Will All Scouts please rise. 
            Scouts Attention
            Scouts Sign
            Ready begin:
On my Honor I will do my best
To do my duty to God and my country
And to obey the Scout Law
To help other people at all times
To keep myself physical strong,
Mentally awake and morally straight
At ease, thank you. You may be seated.
