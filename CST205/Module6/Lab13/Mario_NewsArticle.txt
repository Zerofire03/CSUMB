Nintendo’s back in the game cereal game. Rumored for days and now confirmed, Super Mario Cereal becomes part of this nutritious breakfast in December. 
Every box is an Amiibo, unlocking gold coins and hearts in Super Mario Odyssey.
In stores in North America as soon as December 11, Kellogg’s Super Mario Cereal is a mixed berry cereal with Mario-themed marshmallows. 
It looks and sounds sort of like berry flavored Lucky Charms. Licensed cereal has gotten pretty lazy since the days of the Nintendo Cereal System.

But who cares about flavor when you can tap a portion of the cereal box to your Nintendo Switch’s NFC sensor to unlock fabulous prizes in Super Mario Odyssey? 
Well, aside from Snacktaku, which will doubtlessly be putting Nintendo’s breakfast treat to the test.

“This powered-up partnership with Kellogg’s is another exciting way for us to expand the Nintendo brand in unique and creative ways,” said Tom Prata, Nintendo of America’s senior VP of strategic initiatives, via official press release.
“We are always looking for new opportunities to bring smiles to people of all ages, and this is a fun way to kick off the day.”
Hopefully Super Mario Cereal will be a big hit, and one day we’ll get an actual Amiibo of Mario holding a giant spoon.
