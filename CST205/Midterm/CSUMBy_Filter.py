#Midterm: CSUMBy filter

#This filter will take a selfie image and will replace the pixels in the top right to that of an image of the CSUMB logo. 
#Then replace the background of the logo with that of the selfie. 
#Then ask the user to type in their graduating year to write in the bottom of the image with a gold backdrop.
